# Benchmarks

Benchmarks are a powerful tool that allow you to compare your portfolio's performance against a market index (e.g., the S&P 500). This can help you to understand how your investments are performing relative to the broader market.

## Selecting a Benchmark

1.  **Navigate to the Portfolio page**: From the main menu, click on "Portfolio".
2.  **Open the benchmark selector**: In the top-right corner of the portfolio chart, you will find a dropdown menu that allows you to select a benchmark.
3.  **Choose a benchmark**: Select a benchmark from the list to compare it against your portfolio.

## Interpreting the Chart

Once you have selected a benchmark, its performance will be overlaid on your portfolio's value chart. This allows you to see at a glance how your portfolio has performed relative to the benchmark over time.

*   If your portfolio's line is above the benchmark's line, it means your portfolio has outperformed the benchmark.
*   If your portfolio's line is below the benchmark's line, it means your portfolio has underperformed the benchmark.

## Managing Benchmarks

If you have admin privileges, you can manage the available benchmarks by clicking on the "Manage Benchmarks" link in the benchmark selector. This will take you to the admin control panel, where you can add, edit, or remove benchmarks.
